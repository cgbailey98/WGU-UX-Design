      <h1>About Taniti</h1>
      <p>
        Taniti is a small, tropical island located in the Pacific Ocean with
        quite a diverse terrain which includes sandy and rocky beaches, a safe
        harbor, a beautiful rainforest, and a mountainous interior with a small,
        active volcano. The population of Taniti is approximately 20,000, with
        its economy dominated primarily by fishing and agriculture. However,
        recently there has been quite an increase in tourism.
      </p>

      <h1>General Information for Tourists</h1>
      <p>
        Power outlets are 120 volts, which are the same as the outlets in the
        United States. Alcohol sales are restricted between midnight and 9:00
        a.m. The legal drinking age is 18, but not strictly enforced. Over the
        years, and especially with the younger generations, English is becoming
        more common as the spoken language. However, in the more rural areas and
        by older Tanitians, the native language is more common. In Taniti, there
        is one hospital and several clincics. As the rise of tourism increases,
        petty crime is also becoming more common. The country also observes many
        national holidays, which in some cases can affect the operation of
        attractions and restaurants. The currency used in Taniti is the U.S.
        dollar, but euros and yen are accepted as well.
      </p>
